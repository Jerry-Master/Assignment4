## fars_map_state

This is the main function of this package, it plots each accident of some year into a map of the state you choose. To call it just write `fars_map_state(state.num, year)` where the number of a state can be searched in  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_abbreviations)

##fars_summarize_years

This function is another way of visualizing the accidents, instead of plotting into a map it tells you how many there are per year and month. It just need a vector with the years.

##Other functions

The other functions of the package such as `fars_read` or `make_filename` are just useful functions to the two above, they aren't the purpose of this package but you can use if you want to access the data and modify it yourself.
